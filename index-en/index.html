<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Nextcloud Hub is a fully open-source cloud-based content collaboration platform from Germany. Team members can access, share, and edit documents, chat, participate in video calls, and manage emails, calendars, and projects via mobile, desktop, and web interfaces. Currently, Nextcloud's product positioning is a complete collaboration platform that ensures data security, similar to domestic enterprise platforms like DingTalk or Feishu, with the advantage that since its inception in 2016, Nextcloud has been dedicated to building a cloud-based collaboration platform that prioritizes data security compliance, offering more mature cloud-hosted application solutions for data security, significantly reducing deployment and maintenance costs for business users. Nextcloud official website: https://nextcloud.com/</p>
<p>By 2021, Nextcloud had over 400,000 online servers, and by the end of 2023, the Nextcloud team reached 100 members spread across more than 20 countries/regions, working remotely or from offices in Berlin and Stuttgart.</p>
<p>Alibaba Cloud Compute Nest has packaged an all-in-one Nextcloud into a one-click deployment service. You do not need to download code or install complex dependencies, nor do you need to connect to a foreign VPN. Simply fill in a few parameters and wait two minutes to access your Nextcloud application.</p>
